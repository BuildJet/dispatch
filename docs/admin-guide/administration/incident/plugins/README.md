# Plugins

Much of Dispatch's functionality comes from its plugins. The configuration UI is limited to enabling and disabling plugins. By default, no plugins are _required_ to create an incident. As you enable plugins, they will be additive to the incident process (e.g., creating slack channels, google docs, etc.)

Looking to add your own functionality to Dispatch via plugins? See the [contributing](../../contributing/plugins/README.md) documentation.
